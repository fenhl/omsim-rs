simulator and validator for solutions to puzzles from the hit 2017 puzzle game "opus magnum" by zachtronics. it's just like [omsim](https://github.com/ianh/omsim), but in orange.

currently this just parses puzzle and solution files and prints out their info, though parity with the existing omsim is an eventual goal.

usage: `cargo run -- <puzzle file>.puzzle <solution file>.solution`
